# Solaire
Solaire is a fullstack interdisciplinary project that my team and I developed in the fourth semester of college. It consists of an IoT application capable of reading energy produced by solar panels and, based on this, generating personalized dashboards with statistical calculations studied throughout the semester.

This is the mobile version, developed with React-Native and MongoDB.
